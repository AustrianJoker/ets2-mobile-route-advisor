# ETS2 Mobile Route Advisor
Euro Truck Simulator 2's Route Advisor, for mobile devices.

## Features
The mobile Route Advisor is planned to include all features that Euro Truck Simulator 2's Route Advisor currently has. These features are:
 - Mini-map
    - The mini-map will be the most difficult to create, as the Telemtry SDK does not provide any graphical representation of the truck's current position in-game, except for X, Y, and Z coordinates.  These coordinates, unfortunately, have no relationship to latitude / longitude coordinates, nor is the ETS 2 map 100% accurate with real roadways. An ETS2 map has been created by Funbit, who created the ETS2 Telemetry server; however there is no relationship to pixels vs in-game coordinates at this time.
 - Current job information
    - Current load
    - Origin city
    - Destination city
    - Payout
    - Time remaining
 - Truck damage / load damage
 - Support for translations
 - km/h or mph for speed
 - 12-hour or 24-hour time format

Some additional features may be added to the mobile Route Advisor. These will be added to the README as they are incorporated into the utility.
