# ETS2 Mobile Route Advisor [![Current Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/mkoch227/ets2-mobile-route-advisor.svg)](https://github.com/mkoch227/ets2-mobile-route-advisor/releases) [![Licensed under the MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mkoch227/ets2-mobile-route-advisor/blob/master/LICENSE)
Euro Truck Simulator 2's Route Advisor, for mobile devices. This is a skin for funbit's [ETS2 Telemetry Web Server](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server).

## Features
The mobile Route Advisor is planned to include all features that Euro Truck Simulator 2's Route Advisor currently has. These features are:
 - Mini-map
    - The mini-map will be the most difficult to create, as the Telemtry SDK does not provide any graphical representation of the truck's current position in-game, except for X, Y, and Z coordinates.  These coordinates, unfortunately, have no relationship to latitude / longitude coordinates, nor is the ETS 2 map 100% accurate with real roadways. An ETS2 map has been created by Funbit, who created the ETS2 Telemetry server; however there is no relationship to pixels vs in-game coordinates at this time.
 - Current job information
    - Current load
    - Origin city
    - Destination city
    - Payout
    - Time remaining
 - Truck damage / load damage
 - Support for translations
 - km/h or mph for speed
 - 12-hour or 24-hour time format

## Languages
Currently, two languages are supported (English (en-US) and Polish (pl-PL)). If you would like to submit a translation, you can do so by submitting a pull request.
