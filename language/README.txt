TRANSLATION README
-----------------------
Translations to the Mobile Route Advisor are welcome. To translate the text in the Mobile Route Advisor to your language of preference, follow these instructions:

1. Make a copy of the "en-US.json" file, renaming it to your language code (the language code can be either 2 or 5 characters).
2. Open your new .json file for your language.
3. For each line, translate the value on the RIGHT-HAND SIDE to the translated equivalent for each line. Example:
    ENGLISH: "Navigation": "Navigation",
    SPANISH: "Navigation": "Navegaci贸n",  <-- CORRECT
             "Navegaci贸n": "Navegaci贸n",  <-- INCORRECT
             "Navegaci贸n": "Navigation",  <-- INCORRECT
4. Once finished, save your .json file.

You can change your preferred language by opening config.json and entering in the file name of your language file. I am also accepting pull requests for translations.
